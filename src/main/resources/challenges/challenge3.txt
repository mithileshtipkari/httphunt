You might be surprised to know that both of these appeared in the last two sentences. These terms might be unfamiliar, but you may know this punctuation mark by its more common name: the question mark. The question mark has a very simple function in writingâ€”it indicates a question. If a sentence ends with a question mark, then it is asking a question, just as the name suggests."
